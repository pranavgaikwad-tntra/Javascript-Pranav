This program analyzes the marks of students to find the class performance.
It takes a list of students with their names and scores and calculates the average score, the highest and lowest scores, the grade distribution, and the list of students who need to retake the exam. 
It uses simple for loops and if-else conditions to perform these tasks. 
Grades are divided as A (90–100), B (80–89), C (70–79), D (60–69), and F (below 60). 
The program then prints all the results neatly on the screen. 
For example, with 15 students, the output may look like:
Average Score: 70.73  
Highest Score: Pranav (100)  
Lowest Score: Rohan (29)  
Grade Distribution: { A: 3, B: 3, C: 2, D: 3, F: 4 }  
Students Needing Retake: [ 'Rohan', 'Neha', 'Saanvi', 'Dev' ]
